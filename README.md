This is the Python code used for the simulations. The code has been divided into five .py files:
* evolutions_functions.py: contains the functions to define the potential and the evolution of the particle;
* position_time.py: draws the plot of the position of kinesin versus time;
* histogram_velocities.py: draws the histogram of the mean velocities of kinesin over many simulations;
* velocity_versus_diffusion.py: draws the heatmap representing how mean velocity changes by changing diffusion coefficients in the ON and OFF states;
* velocity_versus_rate_constant.py: draws the heatmap representing how mean velocity changes by changing rate constants in the ON and OFF states;
